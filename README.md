# streamFinder
a tool to find streaming URLS based on movie title

This will look for google and duckduckgo links, try to go on streaming websites for you, and return direct streaming urls, without shitty ads from streaming websites.

# /!\

I don't own the movies nor the url hostsing or anything. I'm just googling stuff for you.

Use this tool at your own risks, i'm not responsible if you contribute to the fall of streaming platforms.

# usage

```
virtualenv -p python3.9 .py3
source .py3/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 "Harry Potter 1"
```

# streamFinder
a tool to find streaming URLS based on movie title

This will google and try to go on streaming websites for you, and return direct streaming urls, without ads.

# Notice

I don't own the movies nor the url hostsing or anything. I'm just googling stuff for you.

Use this tool at your own risks, i'm not responsible if you contribute to the fall of streaming platforms.
